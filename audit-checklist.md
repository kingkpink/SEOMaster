# SEO Audit Checklist

Comprehensive checklist for auditing a web project. Work through each section systematically.

## Pre-Audit: Project Discovery

```
- [ ] Identify tech stack (static, SSR, SPA, CMS)
- [ ] Identify build/deploy pipeline
- [ ] Locate HTML templates / layout files
- [ ] Locate existing SEO configuration (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt)
- [ ] Identify all page types (homepage, listing pages, detail pages, blog, etc.)
- [ ] Check for existing structured data
- [ ] Check for existing analytics (GA4, Search Console)
```

## 1. Crawlability

```
